# androidAXMLprinter
A demo of decoding AndroidManifest.xml from .apk file  based on AXMLPrinter2.jar and xmlPullParser.
###Use AXMLPrinter to decode and parse AndroidManifest.xml
###Use xmlPullParser to parse the decoded xml-file for the attribute values I wanna ,for example uses permissions .
###It's just a basic demo,and it seems a little time-consuming.Later I'll try to make it quicker.
###For now to use this code is easy .It has a stable steps.
